## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The Instagram Follower and Following Scraper is a Python program that automates the process of scraping follower and following data from Instagram profiles. It uses Selenium for web automation to collect valuable information such as profile names, profile links, profile image links, blue tick presence, and follow-back status.

## 2. Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

-   Python 3.x
-   Microsoft Edge browser installed
-   Selenium Python package

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

## 3. Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### Configuring the `config.json` File <a name="configuring-the-configjson-file"></a>

Before running the program, configure the `config.json` file in the `./Modules/` directory. Provide your Instagram username and password (ensure that two-factor authentication is disabled) in the following format:

```json
{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password"
}
```

### Running the Program <a name="running-the-program"></a>

To run the Instagram Follower and Following Scraper, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```

The program will log in to your Instagram account, scrape the followers and following data, and store it in CSV files.

### Scraping Specific User's Followers and Following <a name="scraping-specific-users-followers-and-following"></a>

To scrape a specific user's followers and following, you can mention the usernames in a list format in the python main.py by giving argument `users = ["f1", "f2"]`. The program will attempt to scrape data for users whose profiles are public or who you are following.

### CSV File Format <a name="csv-file-format"></a>

The CSV files generated by the program have the following format:

#### followers.csv and following.csv

1.  `Profile Name`: The name of the Instagram user.
2.  `Profile Link`: The link to the user's Instagram profile.
3.  `Profile Image Link`: The link to the user's profile image (if available). If it is "False," it means the user has an active story, and the image link cannot be retrieved.
4.  `Blue Tick`: Either `True` or `False`, based on the presence of a blue verification tick on the account.
5.  `Follow Back`: `True` if you are following the user; otherwise, `False`.

## 4. Important Notes <a name="important-notes"></a>

-   You can run the program multiple times. The program performs a normal login at the start and then saves cookies. For subsequent login attempts, the same cookies are reused, reducing the need for repeated logins.

## 5. Directory Structure <a name="directory-structure"></a>

-   `./Data/followers`: Directory containing followers' CSV files.
-   `./Data/following`: Directory containing following CSV files.
-   `./Modules/`: Directory containing `config.json` and `cookies.json` files.

## 6. Example Data <a name="example-data"></a>

An example data, "f1" Instagram profile of followers and following has been scraped. You can find the CSV files here:

-   Followers: `./Data/Followers/f1_followers.csv`
-   Following: `./Data/Following/f1_following.csv`
